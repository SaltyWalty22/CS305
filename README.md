•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individual financial plans for their customers. They wanted to customize their software and make sure there are using the most current and effective security software. 

•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I identified their current vulnerabilities by running a dependency check and doing static testing on their code. For companies like Artemis Financial having good security can make or break their company, if customers can’t trust that their information isn’t safe and secure they will take their business elsewhere.

•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Being able to run and utilize dependency checks was very helpful but could feel challenging at a glance due to the large amount of information it provided.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
By using the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, I was able to address the parts and increase the layers of security that needed to be addressed. Going forward, dependency checks need to be done on a regular basis to protect against any new discovered vulnerabilities. 

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring the code I reran the dependency check and made sure that new vulnerabilities arose and if they did I would look into why they are appearing now so I could get them addressed. 

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
With the use of the web, I was able to research what others issues people have encountered and how they handled it. Using Stackoverflow forums were of benefits at time as they helped explain why certain things could be done or had to be done other ways.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
With the use of GitHub, I could should employers I know how to code or handle similar situations that would arise from this new job. For this assignment I would show them how I understand the cause and effect of using dependencies and the risk that come with them and whether they can be avoided or not.
